Chapter 11
aerobic metabolism, metabolism that can proceed only in the presence of oxygen
aerosol-generating procedure, any airway manipulation that induces the production of aerosols that may present a risk for airborne transmission of pathogens such as CPR
agonal gasps, abnormal breathing pattern characterized by slow gasping breaths sometimes seen in patient in cardiac arrest
airway, the upper airway tract of the passage above the larynx which includes the nose mouth and throat
alveolar minute volume, the volume of air moved through the lungs in 1 minute minus the dead space calculated by multiplying tidal volume (minus dead space) and respiratory rate
alveolar ventilation, the volume of air that reaches the alveoli. it is determined by subtracting the amount of dead space air from tidal volume
american standard safety system, a safety system for large oxygen cylinders designed to prevent the accidental attachment of a regulator to a cylinder containing the wrong type of gasping
apnea, absence of spontaneous breathing
apneic oxygenation, a technique in which oxygen administered via a high-flow nasal cannula is left in place during an intubation attempt allowing for continuous oxygen delivery into the airways during all phase of the procedure
aspiration, in context of the airway the introduction of vomitus or other foreign material into the lungs
ataxic respirations, irregular ineffective respirations that may or may not have an identifiable pattern
automatic transport ventilator (ATV), a ventilation device attached to a control box that allows the variables of ventilation to be set. It frees the EMT to perform other tasks while the patient is being ventilated
bag-mask device, a device with a one-way valve and a face mask attached to a ventilation bag; when attached to a reservoir and connected to oxygen it delivers more than 90% supplemental oxygen
barrier device, a protective item such as a pocket mask with a valve that limits exposure to a patient's body fluid
bilateral, a body part or condition that appears on both sides of the midline

Chapter 16
acidosis, the buildup of excess acid in the blood or body tissues that can result a primary illness.
adventitious breath sounds, abnormal breath sounds such as weezing stridor rhonchi and crackles.
alkalosis, the buildup of excess base (lack of acids) in the body fluid.
allergen, a substance that causes an allergic reaction.
anaphylaxis, an extreme life threatening systemic allergic reaction that may include shock and respitory failure.
asthma, an acute spasm of the smaller air passage called bronchioles associated with excessive mucus production and with swellling of the mucous lining of the respiratory passages.
atelectasis, collapse of the alveolar air spaces of the lungs.
pulminary contusion, bruise on lungs
bronchial breath sounds, normal breath sounds made by air moving through the bronchi.
bronchiolitis, inflammation of the bronchioles that usually occurs in children younger than 2 years and is often caused by the respiratory syncytial virus.
carbon dioxide retention, a condition characterized by a chronically high blood pressure level of carbon dioxide in which the respiratory center no longer responds to high blood levels of carbon dioxide.
carbon monoxide, an odorless colorless tasteless and highly poisonous gas that results from incomplete oxidation of carbon in combustion.
chronic bronchitis, irritation of the major lung passageways from long-term exposure to infectious disease or irritants such as smoke.
chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), a lung disease characterized by chronic obstruction of lung airflow that interferes with normal breathing and is not fully reversible.
continuous positive airway pressure (CPAP), a method of ventilation used primarily in the treatment of critically ill patients with respiratory distress; can prevent the need for endotracheal intubation.
COVID-19, a respiratory disease caused by the virus SARS-CoV-2. The virus is a coronavirus similar to the one that causes the common cold.
crackles, crackling rattling breath sounds that signal fluid in the airspacs of the lungs.
croup, a viral inflammatory disease of the upper respiratory system that may cause a partial airway obstruction and is characterized by a barking cough; usually seen in children.
